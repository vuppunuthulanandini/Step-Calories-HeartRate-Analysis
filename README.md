# Fitness Tracker Data Visualization

## Overview

This project uses **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** to create interactive visualizations of fitness data. The dataset includes information on various fitness metrics such as **steps walked**, **calories burned**, **hours slept**, and **heart rate** over time. The goal is to provide users with meaningful insights into their fitness activities, allowing them to track their daily progress and identify trends in their health data.

## Features

- **Line Plot**: Visualizes the trend of **steps walked** over time.
- **Scatter Plot**: Displays the relationship between **calories burned** and **steps walked**.
- **Box Plot**: Shows the distribution of **hours slept**.
- **Pie Chart**: Represents the breakdown of different fitness activities.
- **Histogram**: Displays the frequency distribution of **steps walked**.
- **Bar Chart**: Compares **steps walked** against **calories burned**.
- **Stack Plot**: Visualizes multiple fitness metrics (steps, calories, hours slept) over time.
- **Interactive Plots**: Users can zoom in, hover for detailed values, and explore data in an interactive manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Matplotlib**: For static visualizations (line plots, bar charts, histograms, etc.).
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive plots (scatter plots, pie charts, box plots, etc.).
- **Pandas**: For handling and manipulating the fitness data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **Matplotlib**
- **Plotly**
- **Pandas**

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
